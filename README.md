Hello Everybody!

This is a personal web page about my previous works in Architecture and Creative Coding. Site itself can be considered a project since it was done by myself from scratch.

The page implemented using Jekyll. Development powered with Gulp for Browser-sync and deployment features.
Site is statically hosted on Github Pages. Built version can be found here: [my site](https://daniil.koshelyuk.site)

Please contact me if you want to use any content at [this email](mailto:daniil.koshelyuk@gmail.com).
